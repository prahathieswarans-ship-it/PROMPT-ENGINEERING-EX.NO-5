# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS
## DATE : 20.12.2025
## ROLL NO: 25013305

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

# Algorithm:
Define two prompt types: naïve (broad) and basic (clear, structured).

Create multiple test scenarios targeting creative, factual, summarizing, and comparative tasks.

For each scenario, input both naïve and basic prompts into ChatGPT and record the responses.

Compare outputs based on quality, accuracy, and depth.

Analyze findings to determine the impact of prompt clarity on ChatGPT’s performance.

## OUTPUT
## Purpose:
To test and compare how two large language models — ChatGPT and Gemini — respond to different prompting patterns, specifically examining their behavior when given broad (unstructured) versus refined (clear) prompts, across different prompt styles.

## Prompt Type 1: Intuition Behind Prompts
Prompt A (Broad):
"Tell me something interesting."

## ChatGPT:
Two hearts pump blood to the gills, one to the body—and they stop the body-pumping heart when they swim.

## Gemini:
Bees make honey, and its low water content and acidity prevent bacteria from thriving, allowing it to last indefinitely if stored properly.

## Prompt B (Refined):
"Explain the intuition behind how prompts work in AI language models with two simple examples."

## ChatGPT:
Prompts guide the AI on what to say by giving it context.

## Example 1:
Prompt: “Translate to French: Good morning” → AI sees “Translate” and gives “Bonjour” — it's following the instruction.

## Example 2:
Prompt: “Once upon a time,” → AI continues with a story — it sees this as a storytelling cue. Prompts shape the AI’s response style and content.

## Gemini:
AI language models predict the next words. Prompts provide context to guide this prediction.

## Example 1:
Prompt: "The sky is..." Intuition: The model predicts words commonly following "The sky is," like "blue" or "cloudy."

## Example 2:
Prompt: "Translate 'hello' to French." Intuition: The model recognizes the translation task and predicts "bonjour."

## Prompt Type 2: Straightforward Prompts
Prompt A (Broad):
"Rain."

## ChatGPT:
Rain forms when moist air cools, condenses into droplets, and falls from clouds due to gravity

## Gemini:
Water falling from clouds.

## Prompt B (Refined):
"Explain what causes rainfall in 1-2 sentences."

## ChatGPT:
Rainfall happens when warm, moist air rises, cools, and condenses into water droplets in clouds. When these droplets grow heavy enough, they fall as rain.

## Gemini:
Warm, moist air rises, cools, and condenses into water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds. When these droplets or crystals become too heavy, they fall to the Earth as rain.

## Prompt Type 3: Tabular Format Prompting
Prompt A (Broad):
"Tell me different types of energy."

## ChatGPT:
Kinetic Energy,Potential Energy,Thermal (Heat) Energy,Chemical Energy,Electrical Energy,Nuclear Energy,Light (Radiant) Energy,Sound Energy

## Gemini:
There are many types of energy, broadly categorized as kinetic (energy of motion) and potential (stored energy).

## Examples include:
Kinetic: Motion, thermal (heat), radiant (light), electrical, sound.
Potential: Chemical, gravitational, nuclear, elastic, mechanical.
Energy sources can also be classified as renewable (naturally replenished, like solar, wind, and hydro) and non-renewable (finite resources, like fossil fuels and nuclear).


## Prompt B (Refined):
"List 3 types of energy in a table with their definition and example."

## ChatGPT:
```txt
Kinetic Energy	Energy of motion.	A moving car.
Potential Energy	Stored energy due to position or condition.	A stretched rubber band.
Thermal Energy	Energy from the movement of particles in matter.	Boiling water.
```
## Gemini:
```txt
Kinetic	Energy of motion	A moving car
Potential	Stored energy due to position	A ball held at a height
Thermal	Energy due to temperature	Heat from a stove burner
```
## Prompt Type 4: Comparative Analysis Prompt
Prompt A (Broad):
"Compare things."

## ChatGPT:
Here are some comparisons:

1. Apples vs. Oranges
o Apples: Crisp, sweet or tart, commonly eaten raw. o Oranges: Juicy, tangy, mostly consumed as juice or fresh.

2. Cars vs. Bicycles
o Cars: Faster, require fuel, can travel long distances. o Bicycles: Slower, eco-friendly, require physical effort.

## Gemini:
Apples are sweet and crunchy, while oranges are citrusy and juicy. Both are fruits but offer different tastes and textures.

## Prompt B (Refined):
" Compare the effectiveness of rule-based systems and machine learning models in solving complex problems”

## ChatGPT:
Rule-based systems use predefined rules, making them effective for simple tasks but struggle with complexity and adaptability. They require manual updates for maintenance. Machine learning models, on the other hand, learn from data, handle complex problems better, and improve over time with more data. They are more adaptable and typically perform better in uncertain scenarios.

## Gemini:
Rule-based systems excel in well-defined problems with clear, logical rules, offering transparency and consistency. However, they struggle with complex, dynamic situations requiring adaptation and learning. Machine learning models, on the other hand, learn from data to solve intricate problems, improve with more data, and handle ambiguity, but can be less transparent and require significant data for training.

## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of quality, accuracy, and depth, both AI models perform well, with slight differences:
1. Quality:
Chat GPT provides more detailed explanations, while Gemini is generally more concise and focused.

2. Accuracy:
Complex scenarios tend to be handled more accurately by ChatGPT, whereas simpler, straightforward tasks are more precisely handled by Gemini

3. Depth:
Gemini offers deeper responses in unstructured or broad prompts, while ChatGPT is more efficient in structured, refined prompts. Overall, the best model depends on user preference for detail, clarity, and the complexity of the prompt. Gemini is the best choice for users seeking more depth and detailed explanations

## Result:
The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully
